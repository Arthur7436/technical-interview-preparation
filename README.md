# Technical interview preparation

I would like to have this file as evidence of my own progress in learning a brand new coding language such as Python. 

Context: There is a technical interview coming in exactly 2 weeks and I would like to look back at this repository when the 2 weeks are over. I desire to understand the basic concepts of programming and would like to work autonomously once the foundations have been laid.

I am very new to programming and only started to learn HTML and CSS around late July this year and am wanting to prove myself that I am able to do well in the upcoming technical interview.

My approach in the following 14 days include, where most of them are for free:

+ Google
+ Youtube
+ Udemy
+ Leetcode
+ Codewars
